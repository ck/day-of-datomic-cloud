# day-of-datomic-cloud

Day of Datomic Cloud project is a collection of samples and tutorials
for learning [Datomic Cloud](http://datomic.com) at a Clojure REPL.

## Getting Started

* Install Clojure:
```
$ brew install clojure
```

* [Create a Datomic Cloud System](https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/getting-started/getting-started.html).

* Clone this repo locally

* Copy config.edn.example to config.edn and edit config.edn, providing your Datomic Cloud connection [configuration information](https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/getting-started/connecting.html#creating-database).

* Make sure you are running a [SOCKS Proxy](https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/getting-started/configuring-access.html#socks-proxy) to your Datomic Cloud Bastion.

* Start a Clojure REPL in the day-of-datomic-cloud directory:
```
$ clj
```

Work through some of the tutorials in the tutorial directory,
evaluating each form at the REPL. You might start with:

* hello_world.repl
* social_news.repl
* provenance.repl
* graph.repl
* filters.repl

## Study the Samples

As or after you work through the tutorial, you may want to also study
the helper functions in src/datomic/samples.
