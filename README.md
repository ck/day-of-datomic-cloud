# day-of-datomic-cloud

Day of Datomic Cloud project is a collection of samples and tutorials
for learning [Datomic Cloud](http://datomic.com) at a Clojure REPL.

## Getting Started

[Create a Datomic Cloud System](https://docs-gateway-dev2-952644531.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:8181/cloud/getting-started/getting-started.html).

Work through some of the tutorials in the tutorial directory,
evaluating each form at the REPL. You might start with:

* hello_world.clj
* filters.clj

## Study the Samples

As or after you work through the tutorial, you may want to also study
the helper functions in src/datomic/samples.
